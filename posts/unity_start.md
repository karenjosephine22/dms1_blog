*We began our journey into Unity by downloading the software and diving into the basic concepts, like creating simple shapes such as cubes and spheres, and making materials to give our 3D objects some personality. While these concepts seemed pretty straightforward, I found myself struggling a bit with navigating and viewing the 3D space💤. It took some time to get used to the controls and see everything from different angles🚀. Still, today’s lesson really helped me build a solid foundation for understanding the software, and I’m genuinely excited to see what’s next!*

## Change

*Discovering Disney was a turning point in my life. As a child, As a child, Disney opened up a world of wonder, where stories came alive and anything felt possible⚜️. The vibrant characters, enchanting narratives, and moral lessons embedded in the films taught me many valuable values in my life.*

*Through the years, Disney's inspired my love for music and animation, sparking my creativity. It helped me see the world in a more imaginative way, turning everyday moments into something special🌼. Now, as an adult, I realize that Disney is more than just entertainment; it’s a big part of who I am. Through my project, I want to show this journey of change and how Disney has enriched my life, inspiring me to embrace creativity and imagination..*

*This journey begins in a stark black-and-white landscape, symbolizing the dullness of life without the magic of storytelling and creativity that Disney instills. As players navigate through this terrain, they’ll encounter four iconic landmarks inspired by the movie "Tangled": Rapunzel’s tower, the enchanting castle, a serene lake, and the lively Snuggly Duckling🐥. The environment gradually evolves in color, sound, and layout, leading to an expansive, vibrant open world that invites exploration and discovery. Users can also search items tied to the film!.*
