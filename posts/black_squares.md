## Black Square Activity⬛
*As I start my journey with Adobe Illustrator, we were tasked to create four black squares, each reflecting a different theme: Order, Increase, Bold, Congested, Tension, and Playful. Squares might seem simple, but when you use them in classic black, they become a powerful tool for all kinds of designs. Using shortcuts like copy-paste, Shift, and the Space Bar made getting started with Adobe Illustrator a fun and easy learning experience.*

Each icon needs to provide audiovisual feedback, with an image swap and a thematic sound effect when users hover or click. I’ve chosen to focus on the themes of Memory🧠 and Growth🌿. Here’s how I brainstormed ideas for these themes*
