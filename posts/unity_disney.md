## Terrain and Progress
*It’s time to dive into creating the Disney terrain! I started by watching and following a YouTube tutorial to help bring my vision to life. With each landmark from the movie, I began to shape the world in my mind, focusing on details that would make it feel magical. I added water features, a tall tower, vibrant flowers, and trees to capture the enchanting atmosphere of the film. I made sure that every element fit together seamlessly, ensuring they complemented each other and enhanced the overall experience.*

## Love is an Open Door
*Creating the door was much simpler than the portal! Although my initial plan was to animate a wardrobe opening like in the movie Narnia, I couldn’t find the right asset for that design. Instead, I decided to focus on making a traditional door. All I needed to do was find the right YouTube tutorial and follow along, and yay—it worked!*
