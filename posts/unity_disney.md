*It’s time to dive into creating the Disney terrain! I started by watching and following a YouTube tutorial to help bring my vision to life. With each landmark from the movie, I began to shape the world in my mind, focusing on details that would make it feel magical. I added water features, a tall tower, vibrant flowers, and trees to capture the enchanting atmosphere of the film. I made sure that every element fit together seamlessly, ensuring they complemented each other and enhanced the overall experience.*

## Love is an Open Door

*Creating the door was surprisingly much simpler than crafting the portal! Initially, I had envisioned animating a wardrobe that would swing open just like in the movie "Narnia." Excited about the idea, I began searching for the perfect asset to bring that design to life, but I faced some challenges in finding the right style. Instead of getting discouraged, I decided to pivot my approach and focus on a more traditional door. This shift allowed me to simplify the process while still capturing a sense of charm and authenticity. I turned to resources like Sketchfab, where I found a variety of suitable options that fit my vision perfectly.*

*Once I had the asset downloaded, I sought out a comprehensive YouTube tutorial to guide me through the animation process. Following along step by step, I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly everything came together. Ultimately, my decision to adapt my original idea not only made the project more manageable but also allowed me to learn new techniques along the way. I felt a great sense of accomplishment when it finally worked, and the door now stands as a testament to the journey of creativity and adaptation that defines this project.*
