## Assignment 1 - Video Edit
*Approach to Sonic and Visual Components: In my video edit, I sought to create a dynamic relationship between the sonic and visual elements. The background music, which is the last song I sang with my high school choir, holds deep emotional significance for me. I chose it intentionally to evoke feelings of nostalgia and connection, bridging my past experiences with my current journey as an international student. The contrasting pacing of the visuals mirrors the emotional journey, beginning with fast-paced, packed scenes that convey the chaos of life, transitioning to more serene moments in the second half.*

*Footage Selection: The footage I selected was primarily shot in a park, chosen for its ability to evoke childhood memories and a sense of nostalgia. The initial fast-paced scenes reflect the overwhelming nature of my new environment, while the latter half features children playing in the playground. These moments symbolize pure joy and carefree happiness, accentuated by the sounds of laughter, creating a calming counterbalance to the earlier chaos.*

*The Power of Sound in Emotional Experience: Through this project, I learned how profoundly sound can shape emotional experiences. The choir song, laden with personal meaning, provided a backdrop that resonated with my memories of camaraderie and joy. By synchronizing the visuals to key moments in the music, I amplified the emotional impact. The laughter of children and the soothing soundscape enriched the overall experience, grounding me in moments of tranquility amidst my transition.*

*Editing, Pacing, and Rhythm: Editing plays a crucial role in establishing pacing and rhythm, which I consciously applied throughout my project. The first half features quick cuts and energetic visuals, creating a sense of urgency, while the second half slows down to highlight the calming scenes of children at play. This shift in pacing reflects my journey from feeling overwhelmed to finding peace, emphasizing the contrasting emotions I wanted to convey.*

*Personal Reflection in the Portrait: In my video portrait, I chose to depict aspects of my personality, interests, and experiences. My love for singing and the bonds formed in my choir are central to my identity, alongside the challenges and growth I've faced as an international student. This duality—embracing both joy and solitude—was a key focus in my portrayal, particularly in how I transitioned from chaos to serenity.*

*Aesthetic Choices: My primary aesthetic choices aimed to express themes of nostalgia and tranquility. I opted for soft color palettes and natural lighting to evoke warmth and familiarity. The contrasting visual styles—fast-paced scenes followed by calming moments—symbolized the transition from the complexities of adult life to the simplicity of childhood joy. This was further enhanced by the laughter of children and the serene park setting, representing a return to simpler, more joyful times.*
