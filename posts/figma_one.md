## Assignment 1 - Video Edit
*1. Approach to Sonic and Visual Components: In my video edit, I sought to create a dynamic relationship between the sonic and visual elements. The background music, which is the last song I sang with my high school choir, holds deep emotional significance for me. I chose it intentionally to evoke feelings of nostalgia and connection, bridging my past experiences with my current journey as an international student. The contrasting pacing of the visuals mirrors the emotional journey, beginning with fast-paced, packed scenes that convey the chaos of life, transitioning to more serene moments in the second half.*

*2. Footage Selection: The footage I selected was primarily shot in a park, chosen for its ability to evoke childhood memories and a sense of nostalgia. The initial fast-paced scenes reflect the overwhelming nature of my new environment, while the latter half features children playing in the playground. These moments symbolize pure joy and carefree happiness, accentuated by the sounds of laughter, creating a calming counterbalance to the earlier chaos.*

*3. The Power of Sound in Emotional Experience: Through this project, I learned how profoundly sound can shape emotional experiences. The choir song, laden with personal meaning, provided a backdrop that resonated with my memories of camaraderie and joy. By synchronizing the visuals to key moments in the music, I amplified the emotional impact. The laughter of children and the soothing soundscape enriched the overall experience, grounding me in moments of tranquility amidst my transition.*

*4. Editing, Pacing, and Rhythm: Editing plays a crucial role in establishing pacing and rhythm, which I consciously applied throughout my project. The first half features quick cuts and energetic visuals, creating a sense of urgency, while the second half slows down to highlight the calming scenes of children at play. This shift in pacing reflects my journey from feeling overwhelmed to finding peace, emphasizing the contrasting emotions I wanted to convey.*

*5. Personal Reflection in the Portrait: In my video portrait, I chose to depict aspects of my personality, interests, and experiences. My love for singing and the bonds formed in my choir are central to my identity, alongside the challenges and growth I've faced as an international student. This duality—embracing both joy and solitude—was a key focus in my portrayal, particularly in how I transitioned from chaos to serenity.*

*6. Aesthetic Choices: My primary aesthetic choices aimed to express themes of nostalgia and tranquility. I opted for soft color palettes and natural lighting to evoke warmth and familiarity. The contrasting visual styles—fast-paced scenes followed by calming moments—symbolized the transition from the complexities of adult life to the simplicity of childhood joy. This was further enhanced by the laughter of children and the serene park setting, representing a return to simpler, more joyful times.*

## Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons
*1. Concept Summary and Theme Choice: My suite of icons revolves around the theme of "Growth," symbolizing the transformative processes inherent in life. I chose this theme because it resonates deeply with the concept of change, which is an inevitable part of our experiences. The nine icons—horse, acorn, lotus flower, hyacinth, sun/moon, butterfly, arrow, tree, and koi fish—each represent different aspects of growth and transformation, capturing the journey from potential to realization.*

*2. Iteration Process: I iterated through several approaches before finalizing my designs. Initially, I explored various symbols of growth but settled on the nine that I felt best illustrated the theme. Throughout the iterations, I shifted from more complex designs to simpler, more iconic representations. This simplification allowed the symbols to convey their meanings more effectively, culminating in a cohesive set that embodies the essence of growth.*

*3. Translation from Sketches to Final Designs: Translating my thumbnail sketches into final designs in Illustrator involved refining the shapes and ensuring consistency in style. While some nuances from the initial sketches were lost, such as hand-drawn details, I gained clarity and precision in the final icons. The digital medium allowed me to enhance proportions and alignments, resulting in polished designs that effectively communicate the theme.*

*4. Use of Color for Unity and Interest: I used a two-part color strategy to create unity and visual interest: the first set of icons is presented in a monochrome black-and-white palette, while the second set bursts with vibrant colors. This transition symbolizes the journey of growth, with the colorful icons representing the flourishing outcomes of change. The choice of colors reflects the idea of vibrancy and life, enhancing the overall impact of the icons.*

*5. Correspondence of Sound and Visual Design: The elements and principles of sound in my audio design mirrored the visual design principles I employed. Just as the visuals communicate growth through gradual transitions and transformations, the audio incorporates evolving melodies and harmonies that evoke feelings of progress and change. This synergy reinforces the theme of growth, creating a cohesive experience across both mediums.*

*6. From Abstract to Concrete Designs: To translate my chosen prompt of "Growth" from an abstract idea to concrete visual designs, I focused on symbols that inherently represent change and development. I brainstormed various natural and metaphorical representations of growth and distilled these concepts into clear, recognizable icons. This process involved selecting symbols that resonate with the theme while ensuring each design conveys a unique aspect of growth, resulting in a cohesive and meaningful set of icons.*
