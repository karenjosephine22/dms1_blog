*Exploring the concept of audio involved a multifaceted and hands-on experience using Adobe Premiere Pro. Tasked with creating an experimental edit using provided clips from other groups, I focused on integrating audio effectively to enhance the footage. The process began with extensive experimentation, where I played around with different audio tracks and sound effects, testing how each element affected the overall feel of the edit. This experimentation was crucial for understanding how audio can influence mood, pacing, and narrative structure. Overall, this hands-on exploration of audio within Premiere Pro was a valuable learning experience, helping me appreciate the critical role of sound in editing and how it can dramatically alter the perception of footage.*

*Through a visual and auditory journey, I spent time reflecting on what aspects of myself I wished to convey and how to represent these ideas through my video. The self-portrait video I created serves as a reflective exploration of personal growth and self-discovery, capturing the nuances of both the complexity and simplicity. Over the past few weeks, I filmed various videos of the things I like that resonate with me and merged them into an abstract composition. This process has been both enjoyable and introspective, prompting me to reflect on my evolving identity and the theme of personal growth.*
