*Exploring the concept of audio involved a multifaceted and hands-on experience using Adobe Premiere Pro. Tasked with creating an experimental edit using provided clips from other groups, I focused on integrating audio effectively to enhance the footage. The process began with extensive experimentation, where I played around with different audio tracks and sound effects, testing how each element affected the overall feel of the edit. This experimentation was crucial for understanding how audio can influence mood, pacing, and narrative structure. Overall, this hands-on exploration of audio within Premiere Pro was a valuable learning experience, helping me appreciate the critical role of sound in editing and how it can dramatically alter the perception of footage.*
