*Learning to use the character controller and create terrain with adjustable heights was an exciting experience! It felt empowering to shape the environment exactly as I envisioned, allowing for a more personalized and immersive world. Seeing the terrain come to life with varied elevations added a dynamic quality that really enhanced the overall design.*

*However, I did encounter some challenges with the scripting aspect at times. While I grasped the basics, certain elements felt a bit confusing, which occasionally slowed my progress. Despite this, the opportunity to experiment and problem-solve made the learning process all the more rewarding.*
