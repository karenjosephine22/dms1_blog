## What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
*When I think about the vibe I want my artist portfolio to have, keywords like "minimalist," "elegant," and "creative" come to mind. I want it to feel fresh and modern while still showcasing my unique style. I also want to incorporate words like "dynamic" and "intuitive" because I believe the design should engage visitors and be super easy to navigate. Ultimately, I want my work to take center stage without any distractions!*

## Who is the target audience?
*As for my target audience, I’m hoping to reach a mix of art lovers, potential clients, and fellow artists. I want art enthusiasts who are excited to explore new styles, clients who are searching for their next creative project, and collaborators interested in teaming up. Understanding who I’m speaking to helps me create content that really resonates with them.*

## What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?
*In terms of features, I’m focusing on making sure my portfolio has everything visitors want to see. I definitely want a stunning gallery to showcase my artwork front and center. An engaging artist bio is a must, too, so people can get to know me better. I’ll include easy-to-find contact info for inquiries and links to my social media so folks can follow my journey.*

*Today in class, we took our first steps into Figma, the design tool we'll use for our final assignment, and it was an exciting introduction to creating an artist portfolio. We learned how to design scrolling pages, which will help viewers navigate through different sections of our work smoothly. Exploring gradients for text and backgrounds added depth to our designs, while delving into animations showed us how to bring our portfolios to life and engage audiences more dynamically.*
