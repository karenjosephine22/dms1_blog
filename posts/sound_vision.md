## What is the emotional tone of the broader portrait, and how are your editing choices going to support that tone generally?
*To effectively convey warmth, comfort, and calmness, while also utilizing a montage to create a juxtaposition, I'm planning to use warm and cool tone as the color grading, soft lighting and lower contrast which contributes to a more soothing and less dramatic visual experience. Close-ups or medium shots to focus on details and juxtaposition to incorporate a montage that contrasts two different elements or locations. Smooth transitions and relaxed pacing, with deliberate and gentle cuts to reinforce the feeling of tranquility. Finally matching the audio that complement the visual tone.*

## What does the audience need to understand about the relationship between shots in this moment? What connection are you trying to forge?
*In this moment, the goal is to forge a meaningful connection that enhances the viewer's understanding of the emotional or conceptual contrasts being highlighted. For instance, if the shots juxtapose a serene, comforting scene with a bustling, intense environment, the audience should recognize how these contrasting elements emphasize the broader theme of balance or the tension between tranquility and chaos. By aligning visual continuity, thematic consistency, and sound design, to create a cohesive experience that guides the audience through the intended emotional journey or narrative progression.*

## What sort of rhythm, tempo, or pace are you attempting to establish during this moment? How will your editing produce this?
*I aim to establish a rhythm that reflects the emotional tone and narrative progression. The tempo or pace will be crafted to either create a sense of calm and introspection or to build tension and excitement, depending on the desired impact. By controling the timing of cuts, the duration of each shot, and the flow of transitions with the rhythm of the accompanying audio and visual elements.*
