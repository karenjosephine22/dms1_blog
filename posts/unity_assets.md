*Greyboxing is a great method for planning future projects, allowing you to visualize your ideas before diving in. I didn‚Äôt create a greybox this time because I already had a clear idea of what I wanted to make and the key landmarks I wanted to include.*

# Importing Sounds
![empat](week8empat.jpeg)

*In today‚Äôs class, we explored the process of importing sound into specific objects, and while it initially seemed a bit daunting, I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it turned out to be. The key was finding the right sounds that would complement the environment we were creating, which added an extra layer of depth to our work.*

*It was truly exciting to witness how sound can enhance the overall experience. The addition of audio not only brought the scene to life but also helped to immerse viewers in the world we were building. This newfound understanding of sound design has inspired me to think more creatively about how to use audio in my projects moving forward.*
