# GreyBox Method🍁

*Greyboxing is an excellent method for planning future projects, as it enables creators to visualize their ideas and concepts before fully committing to the design process. This technique often serves as a valuable foundation, helping to identify potential challenges and streamline workflows. By sketching out basic shapes and forms, you can quickly assess the layout and scale of your environment, making adjustments as needed. It’s a practical approach that fosters creativity and encourages experimentation without the pressure of detailed final assets. However, I didn’t create a greybox for this project because I already had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve and the key landmarks I wanted to include🧸.*

# Importing Sounds

*In today’s class, we explored the process of importing sound into specific objects🎶, and while it initially seemed a bit daunting, I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it turned out to be. The key was finding the right sounds that would complement the environment we were creating✨, which added an extra layer of depth to our work.*

*It was truly exciting to witness how sound can enhance the overall experience. The addition of audio not only brought the scene to life but also helped to immerse viewers in the world we were building. This newfound understanding of sound design has inspired me to think more creatively about how to use audio in my projects moving forward🌻.*
