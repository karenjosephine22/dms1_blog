## Getting HTML working
*Downloading HTML files and getting them to work should be a straightforward process. Yet, my journey turned into an epic battle against a giant wall of frustration. Despite days of troubleshooting, re-downloading files, and seeking advice from friends and online communities, the issue persisted👾. It wasn't until a conversation with my dad's friend from the IT field that I stumbled upon a surprisingly simple solution — uninstalling the antivirus. This blog post chronicles my experience and highlights how a seemingly simple fix can sometimes be hidden behind sleepless nights😪.*
