*Today’s class was all about creating wireframes for a website, and guess what? I picked WhatsApp, the go-to app I use to chat with my friends! At first, we were tasked with sketching it from memory, which felt like a fun challenge. I mean, I use WhatsApp all the time, so how hard could it be?*

*As I started drawing, I realized I actually remembered a lot of the key features! It’s funny how familiar I am with the layout, even though I never really pay attention to the details. After the memory exercise, we had the chance to look at the real thing and revise our wireframes. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my initial sketches weren’t too far off!*

*Going through the actual app made me notice little details I hadn’t thought about before, like the way chats are organized and those nifty icons. It was a great reminder of how often I use the app, and how those small touches make a big difference. Overall, it was a fun exercise — can’t wait to dive deeper into wireframing!*

## Wireframe Draft

*Finished creating a wireframe for my own artist portfolio! I wanted to keep the design simple yet fun and easy to navigate. While checking out other artists' portfolios for inspiration, I jotted down ideas and sketched my vision. I opted for good old-fashioned drawing instead of using Figma this time—honestly, it felt so much faster and more intuitive! It was great to let my creativity flow without getting bogged down by software.*

*In my wireframe, I focused on ensuring each section flows smoothly, highlighting my artwork and making it easy for visitors to learn about me. I aimed for a design that captures my personality while keeping the user experience in mind.*
