*In today’s class, we learned about the 12-column grid that every website uses. Who would have thought that the behind-the-scenes structure of a website could be so fascinating? To put this newfound knowledge to the test, I checked out a website we all know—Canvas RMIT. It turns out that it doesn’t always have to be 12 columns; I discovered that Canvas uses a 10-column layout! I’m not sure if that’s standard, but it was interesting to see the variation. The 12-column grid is a fundamental design framework that gives websites their clean, sleek look, and it was fun to explore how it works. This discovery has opened my eyes to new possibilities for designing my own website, and I can’t wait to apply what I’ve learned!*
