## The Explosive Cup of Coffee: A Scavenger Hunt Adventure
*Given the task of finding specific items around our new campus, we embarked on an adventurous scavenger hunt. The first intriguing items on the list was an "explosive cup of coffee". We weren't sure what it meant, but we were determined to find out..*

## Digital Media Wisdom Book: To the Library!
*Our scavenger hunt continued. The next item on our list was a "book containing digital media wisdom". Intrigued by the prospect, we headed towards the library, a place we had yet to explore in our new campus.*

## The Flying Paper Cargo: Both Intriguing and Perplexing
*Despite our best efforts, we couldn’t decipher its meaning or figure out where to find it. Determined not to get stuck, we decided to seek some expert advice. Still within the library, we hoped that the knowledgeable staff might be able to help us.*

## The Sith Lord's Study: A Familiar Place
*Determined to figure out why the room felt so familiar, I led my friends and retraced our steps through the library. We arrived at a part of the library I’d visited several days ago, during a different event.*

## The Faraway Beverage Machine: Seeking Guidence yet Again
*After our realization that the “wide machine dispensing beverages from a faraway land” was a vending machine, we needed to find one to continue our scavenger hunt. Remembering our previous success with the library’s helpful staff, we decided to ask Mrs. X , the librarian we had met before.*

## The Disembodied Hands of a Great Ape: A Lucky Break
*After diligently searching around the campus and not finding any further clues, we were starting to feel a bit discouraged. Just as we were about to leave and go on with our next item, we noticed the group from the scavenger hunt. After they finished and left, we hurried back to the statue, and took a selfie with the statue ourselves*

## The Door of the Condemned: A Historical Discovery
*While pondering our options, we bumped into the other group participating in the scavenger hunt. We exchanged a few clues and insights, sharing our respective findings. They mentioned a clue they had come across about a prison..*

## The Curtain of Roots: A Winged Visitor’s Gift
*The scavenger hunt was nearing its end, and we were eager to solve the final puzzles. As we walked along the main road, something caught our eye -- a staircase, partially hidden by a dense curtain of roots and creeping vines.*

## The Basement-Dwelling Black Box
*We headed straight to the building, our steps quick with anticipation. Entering the familiar structure, we bypassed the main floors and headed directly to the basement, knowing that this was where our second final clue was likely hidden.*

## The Golden Globe: Our Final Find
*The golden globe, atop the tower of eights. Time was ticking out, and we had yet to find the last item on our list. Desperation set in. With time almost up, someone pointed out a decorative lampion hanging nearby. It was a yellowish-golden color, and while it wasn’t exactly a globe, it was the closest thing we had found.*
