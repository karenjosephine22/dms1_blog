*In the journey of web design, creating engaging and interactive elements can transform a user's experience. For my final project, I chose to explore this concept by designing a set of growth-themed icons. These icons, which represent various aspects of growth, feature an interactive element that changes their appearance and sounds when clicked. My approach started with a monochromatic color scheme and evolved into vibrant, dynamic visuals that enhance user interaction. Here’s how I brought this idea to life.*
