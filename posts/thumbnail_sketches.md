## Thumbnail Sketches Practice

*Initially, I set out to create a set of nine icons themed around memory, inspired by the emotions in Pixar's "Inside Out" but envisioned as animals. Each animal was to represent a different emotion, aligning with the theme of memory. However, as I delved deeper, I realized that this concept veered away from the central theme of memory. In this blog post, I’ll share how my initial idea evolved into a final project centered on growth-themed icons and the lessons learned along the way.*
